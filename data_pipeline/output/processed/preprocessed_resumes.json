WebMethods validate the received 997 files and send the 997's with rejected status, to OTM.OTM cross checks the rejected EDI 210 files and resends the valid data. b) Contribution * Gather requirements, analyze the existing canonicals. * Develop the interfaces using flow service, create utility services, webService Descriptors.. * Create Unit test plan and Integration test plan documents with sample inputs provided from client. * Prepare all project related documents. * Provide testing support in different environments. 10.
